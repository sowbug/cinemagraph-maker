cinemagraph-maker
=================

Want to make cinemagraphs? Don't want to buy Photoshop? Place very little value on your own time? Then this script is for you.

Instructions
============

1. One way or another, create a series of PNG files that you want to combine into a cinemagraph. Put them in the original/ directory.
2. Edit create_frames to copy the parts you want from frames 1+ to frame 0. Run that script.
3. Run make_gif to combine the frames into your animated GIF.

Warning
=======
This set of scripts is not particularly easy to use. But it's easier than building a cinemagraph directly from the command line using ImageMagick. That's not saying much.
